What do heat transfer, music, JPEG, and Wi-Fi have in common? In 1807 Jean-Baptiste Fourier presented his paper "_On the propagation of heat in solid bodies_" to the Paris Institute and it made a lot nerds happy.

## Inanimate carbon rod

We'll start by looking at this rod with an infrared camera:

<GlowingRod model="simple" />

If we graph the temperature we get a beautifiul sine wave:

<HeatGraph model="simple" />

Let's measure the rod temperature while it cools off:

Fourier found that for a perfect sine wave like ours, we can get the temperature over time using this formula:

> $\cos(\omega x)e^{-k\omega^2t}$

In the programming world we can translate this to the following code currently running on your graphic card:

```glsl
float curve(float x, float t) {
    float o = 2.0 * pi; // omega: adjust frequency
    float k = 1.0; // conductivity: adjust how fast heat propagates

    return cos(o * x) * exp(-k * o * o * t);
}
```

Now here is what happens when we make contact between a hot rod and a cold rod:

<Box
    display="flex"
    flexDirection="row"
    flexWrap="wrap"
    alignItems="center"
    justifyContent="center"
>
    <Box flex={1}>
        <ContactRod cool model="contact" delay={0.2} />
    </Box>
    <Box flex={1}>
        <HeatGraph cool model="contact" delay={0.2} />
    </Box>
    <Box flex={1}>
        <HeatGraph3D model="contact" delay={0.2} />
    </Box>
</Box>

How can we compute the heat flow in this case? We have a formula for sine waves, but what we have here is a square wave.

## Hip to be square

Let's pull some fairly standard electronic music production gear: an oscillator, an oscilloscope, and a spectrum analyzer with an harmonics indicator.

<Oscilloscope />

The numbers on the spectrum analyzer are called harmonics:

-   the first harmonic, also called the fundamental, equals `frequency * 1`
-   the second, also called the octave, equals `frequency * 2`
-   the third equals `frequency * 3`
-   and so on..

If you play with the oscillator a bit you will notice two important things:

-   a sine wave only has one harmonic: itself
-   a square wave only has odd harmonics decreasing exponentially

And that's all a square wave is, a sine wave with odd harmonics decreasing exponentially. So we have everything needed to decompose a square wave into sine waves and compute heat diffusion using them. Let's update our code:

```glsl
float temperature(float x, float t) {
    float o = 2 * pi; // omega: adjust frequency
    float k = 1; // conductivity: adjust how fast heat propagates

    return cos(o * x) * exp(-k * o * o * t);
}

float curve(float x, float t) {
    float h = 3.0; // harmonics
    float c = 0.0; // sum of curves

    // Loop over odd harmonics: 1, 3, 5, 7, ...
    for (float i = 1.0; i <= h; i += 2.0) {
        // add the temperature for frequency * i and amplitude / i
        c += temperature(x * i, t) / i;
    }

    return c;
}
```

## Do the astral plane

But how do you do a Fourier transform?

It's time to open our third eye and switch dimensions: instead of representing time as a plane we're going represent it in its true form, which as we all know is a circle repeating itself.

To help us visualize that, let's make the curve draw into a spinning disk:

<WindingGraph3D toolbox />

Tweaking the rotation speed gives us different shapes. Let's graph the average horizontal position based on the rotation speed:

<WindingGraph2D speed={5} />

Let's plug a square wave generate into this graph and see what happens:

<WindingGraph2D speed={20} harmonics={25} toolbox />

What we have here isn't exactly a Fourier transform, but it's close enough. It does what Fourier transforms does: represent signals as a function of frequency instead of a function time.

## Shape of things to come

Every thing can be represented as signal, and every signal can be represented as an infinite sum of sine waves. So

## Final thoughts

That's all for today folks, hope you enjoyed the ride.

## Appendix

The center of mass visualization is based on [work by Grant Sanderson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY) from [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com), I recommend [checking his videos out](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) if you're interested in this topic.

If you're like me the formula might be hard to grasp:

> $\hat{g}(f)=\int_{t1}^{t2}g(t)e^{-2{\pi}ift}dt$

Here is what I ended up with using JavaScript and simple math:

```js
function kindaFFT({
    // Input signal
    g = (x) => Math.sin(x * Math.PI * 2),
    // Rotation frequency
    f = 1,
    // How many samples should we collect
    samples = 64,
} = {}) {
    // Store the graph data
    let x = []
    let y = []
    // Store weighted averages
    let centerX = 0
    let centerY = 0
    // Store averages weight
    let divider = 0

    // Loop over all the angles
    for (let i = 1; i <= samples; i++) {
        // Loop for each winding rotation
        for (let t = (i / samples) * f; t <= f; t++) {
            // Get the curve value for this angle and winding
            let value = g(t / f)

            // We now have a vector: an angle and an amplitude,
            // convert it vector into cartesian coordinates:
            centerX += value * Math.cos(t * Math.PI * 2)
            centerY += value * Math.sin(t * Math.PI * 2)
            // Add the value to the average weights
            divider += value
        }
    }

    // Compute the average position
    return {
        x: centerX / divider,
        y: centerY / divider,
    }
}
```
