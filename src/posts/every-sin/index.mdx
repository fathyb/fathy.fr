# Every thing is a sin()

In this second blog post I'm going to explain _Fourier series_ from the perspective of a developper who doesn't really understand mathematics.

What do heat transfer, music, SVG, and Wi-Fi have in common? In 1807 Fourier wrote "_Treatise on the propagation of heat in solid bodies_" and it made a lot nerds happy.

## Inanimate carbon rod

We'll start by looking at this rod with an infrared camera:

<GlowingRod model="simple" />

If we graph the temperature we get a beautifiul sine wave:

<HeatGraph model="simple" />

Let's measure the rod temperature while it cools off:

<Box display="flex" flexDirection="row" flexWrap="wrap">
    <GlowingRod cool model="simple" />
    <HeatGraph cool model="simple" />
</Box>
<HeatGraph3D model="simple" />

import KatexStyles from './katex-styles'

Fourier found that for a perfect sine wave like ours, we can get the temperature over time using this formula:

> $\cos(\omega x)e^{-k\omega^2t}$

In the programming world we can translate this to the following code currently running on your graphic card:

```glsl
float curve(float x, float t) {
    float o = 2 * pi; // omega: adjust frequency
    float k = 1; // conductivity: adjust how fast heat propagates

    return cos(o * x) * exp(-k * o * o * t);
}
```

Now here is what happens when we make contact between a hot rod and a cold rod:

<Box display="flex" flexDirection="row" flexWrap="wrap">
    <ContactRod cool model="contact" delay={0.2} />
    <HeatGraph cool model="contact" delay={0.2} />
</Box>
<HeatGraph3D model="contact" delay={0.2} />

How can we compute the heat flow in this case? We have a formula for sine waves, but what we have here is a square wave.

## Hip to be square

It's time for our musical break, here are two unrelated 5 seconds musical samples:

<Box display="flex" flexDirection="row" width="100%" textAlign="center">
    <Box flex={1}>
        <p>Chic - Good Times</p>
    </Box>
    <Box flex={1}>
        <p>Bee Gees - More Than A Woman</p>
    </Box>
</Box>

This level indicator tells us that the Chic song with the bass has a lot of low frequencies, and the Debussy piece with the flute has a lot of high frequencies. How does it do that?

What it does is called an FFT: an Fast Fourier Transform, it computes which sine waves are contained in our signal in real-time. Fourier didn't just found how heat propagates on a perfect sine curve, he found how to decompose any function into a sum of infinite sine waves.

Let's pull some fairly standard electronic music production gear: an oscillator, an oscilloscope, and a spectrum analyzer with an harmonics indicator.

<Oscilloscope />

The numbers on the spectrum analyzer are called harmonics:

-   the first harmonic, also called the fundamental, equals `frequency * 1`
-   the second, also called the octave, equals `frequency * 2`
-   the third equals `frequency * 3`
-   and so on..

If you play with the oscillator a bit you will notice two important things:

-   a sine wave only has one harmonic: itself
-   a square wave only has odd harmonics decreasing exponentially

Let's use the WebAudio API to construct a square wave using harmonics:

```js
// An offline context doesn't need access to speakers
let ctx = new OfflineAudioContext(options)
// Create an analyser to read FFT data
let analyser = ctx.createAnalyser()
// Let's start with 8 harmonics
let harmonics = 8
// We want of square wave of 440 Hz
let frequency = 440

// Loop over odd harmonics
for (let i = 1; i <= harmonics; i += 2) {
    // Create a gain to control the amplitude of the sin wave
    let gain = ctx.createGain()
    // Create an oscillator to generate a sine wave
    let oscillator = ctx.createOscillator()

    // Set an exponential amplitude
    gain.gain.value = 1 / i
    // Generate a sine wave
    oscillator.type = 'sine'
    // Set the harmonic frequency
    oscillator.frequency.setValueAtTime(frequency * i, ctx.currentTime)

    // Harmonic 1: [ Oscillator ] => [ Gain ] =\
    // Harmonic 2: [ Oscillator ] => [ Gain ] ==> [ Analyser ]
    // Harmonic 3: [ Oscillator ] => [ Gain ] =/
    oscillator.connect(gain)
    gain.connect(analyser)
}
```

Let's plug this into our instruments and add a slider for the `harmonics` variable:

<Oscilloscope model="compose" />

You'll notice that nothing changes past the 50th harmonic. This is because our `AudioContext` is configured for human hearing, so it ignores frequencies higher than 22kHz, and `440 * 50 = 22_000`, and that means that at 50 harmonics, our square wave sounds exactly the same to human ear as a real square wave.

## Shape of things to come

We have everything needed to decompose a square wave into sine waves and compute heat diffusion using them. Let's update our code:

```glsl
float temperature(float x, float t) {
    float o = 2 * pi; // omega: adjust frequency
    float k = 1; // conductivity: adjust how fast heat propagates

    return cos(o * x) * exp(-k * o * o * t);
}

float curve(float x, float t) {
    float h = 3.0; // harmonics
    float c = 0.0; // sum of curves

    // Loop over odd harmonics: 1, 3, 5, 7, ...
    for (float i = 1.0; i <= h; i += 2.0) {
        // add the temperature for frequency * i and amplitude / i
        c += temperature(x * i, t) / i;
    }

    return c;
}
```

<HeatGraph3D toolbox harmonics o={1} k={4} offset={0.25} />

You can notice that the lower the harmonics, the higher the interferences are at the contact.

## Astral projection

But how do you make an FFT?

Time to open our third eye and switch dimensions: instead of representing time as a plane we're going represent it in its true form, which as we all know is a circle repeating itself.

To help us visualize that, let's make the curve draw into a rotating disk:

<WindingGraph3D />

If we tweak the rotation speed we get a different shape:

Let's graph the geometric center of mass depending on the rotation speed:

## Final thoughts

That's all for today folks, hope you enjoyed the ride! All the animations on this post are computed in real-time using handwritten WebGL, feel free to [look at the souce code](https://github.com/fathyb/fathy.fr/tree/main/src/posts/every-sin) and even run it locally using the `readme` instructions!
